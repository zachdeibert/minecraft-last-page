# Minecraft Last Page Sieve

For Minecraft's 2020 April Fool's Day snapshot, they released a bunch of new dimensions.
One of these was called "LastPage" in the code, and required finding a string that matches a hash and successfully decrypts a block of encrypted data.
This project was meant to brute force the string.

However, the correct string was found through another method in the meantime, and it is way too long for this algorithm to have ever worked.
